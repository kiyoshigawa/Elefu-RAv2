Elefu RA v2

This is the code repo for the Elefu RA Board version 2. If you bought a RA board from Elefu as part of our kickstarter or from our website, you have a RA v3 board, not a v2. 
Please check out the new Elefu-RAv3 repository on github for the latest code for the v3 board. ( https://github.com/kiyoshigawa/Elefu-RAv3/ )

RA's code is based almost entirely on Marlin (v1 RC2) ( https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/ ) with a few changes made by me to work with the RA board and its peripherals. It still works just like Marlin for almost all printer functions, so the readme for Marlin will work for explaining how the firmware works for the most part.

I have added comment sections for anything I added or changed that explain what I have done. They are prefaced with //ELEFU so they should be easy to find in a search. 

If you find any bugs in the code or have any questions, I can be reached at timanderson at elefu dot com.

Hope you all enjoy RA!

Cheers,
