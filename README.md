Elefu RA v2

This is the code repo for the Elefu RA Board version 2. If you bought a RA board from Elefu as part fo our kickstarter, or from our website, you have a RA v3 board, not a v2. 
Please check out the new Elefu-RAv3 repository on github for the latest code for the v3 board. ( https://github.com/kiyoshigawa/Elefu-RAv3/ )

RA's code is based almost entirely on Marlin (v1) ( https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/ ) with a few changes made by me to work with the RA board.
